# Nodejs_API_Practice

Restful API with  Node.js express and MySQL, Authentication with JWT 
Test API with postman

All Api:
getAlluser
getUserByID
Login
Delete User
Update User

When user login, user been given a JWT token, when we try to use another api diffrent than login, we have to provide 
that specific JWT token to that api to be able to login.
